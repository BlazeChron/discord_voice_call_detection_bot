# Why
Discord bot for detecting users exiting the call within a short time frame (1 minute).


Inspired by the countless times someone had entered and exited without saying a thing.


I can now sleep soundly at night.

# Set Up 
Download this repository.

Create a Discord bot.

Make a file named "secret-password", and paste the bot token into it.

```pip install py-cord```, preferably with a python virtual environment.

```python bot.py```
