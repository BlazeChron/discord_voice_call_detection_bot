Discord bot for detecting users exiting the call within a short time frame (1 minute).


Inspired by the countless times someone had entered and exited without saying a thing.


I can now sleep soundly at night.


Steps to install:

Download this repository.
Create a Discord bot.
Place the bot token in a file "secret-password".
```pip install py-cord```, preferably with a python virtual environment.
```python bot.py```
